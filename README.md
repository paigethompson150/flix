### Notes
This project gave me practice working with swift files and storyboards, as well using the third-party framework Alamofire to query data from an API. I also learned about cell recycling, and how to save memory using the tableview. I've noticed a lot of similarities to web development, but the syntax is completely new for me.

When I was nearly done creating the app, I started getting an error thrown that one of my UIImageViews had a value of 'null' when not allowed. I looked through all of my swift files and couldn't find the variable they were referring to anywhere - I was so confused why Swift was giving me an error for a variable that didn't even exist. I went to office hours for help and my TA was also unsure. It turned out to be painstakingly simple, which was that at some point in my storyboard I had accidentally created two imageViews that were directly layered on top of one another. From now on I won't focus so heavily on my swift files while debugging, but on my storyboard as well!
